# Pen-Testing-CTF
For this project, I used the skills that I learned in over the course of a 24 week cyber security bootcamp to attack a fictional organization and determine its vulnerabilities. During this project I was tasked to look for "flags" within the organization's web application and operating systems to collect in a competition-style Capture the Flag (CTF) game. On Day 1, I exploited vulnerabilities in the organization's web application. On Day 2, I determined what vulnerabilities exist in the organization's Linux servers, and on Day 3, I exploited the organization's Windows servers.
